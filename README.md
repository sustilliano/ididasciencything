  â€¢ HIGH SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple real data sources show correlated patterns

SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION:
  âœ“ Multi-source analysis provides robust correlation detection
  âœ“ Temporal correlations across multiple data sources detected
    This suggests possible common underlying phenomena
  âœ“ Gravitational wave correlations with terrestrial phenomena
    May indicate local environmental sensitivity to spacetime disturbances
  ðŸ”´ HIGH SIGNIFICANCE: Strong evidence for multi-source correlations

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Extend analysis to longer time windows
  2. Include additional real-time data sources
  3. Apply machine learning for pattern detection
  4. Correlate with astronomical events database
